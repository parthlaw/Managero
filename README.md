B-crypt is used for user login password hashing.
Crypto-Js is used for encryption on server side and decryption on client side. This encryption and decryption is applied in user saved passwords in his/her dashboard.
User saved data is presented in cards which rotate on hovering.
There is a seperate card in the end to enter data.
You can logout by clicking on logout button in bottom right corner.
Future scopes: User will set his unique pin after logging in (which is non-recoverable) and thet pin would be used as the encryption key for user's data, so that each user will have a different and unique encryption key.A button to edit data without deleating it will also be provided.
User authentication will also be provided in future.
